# BodyShaming Dataset and Model Training

## Overview
This repository contains an innovative dataset focusing on body shaming, along with the code for training state-of-the-art natural language processing models on this dataset. Specifically, we provide code for training AlBERTo, RoBERTa-xlm, and UmBERTo models.

## Dataset
Our body shaming dataset is curated to address the nuances and complexities of body shaming language across various contexts. It includes a diverse range of text samples collected from social media platforms, forums, and other online sources. The dataset is labeled and annotated to facilitate supervised learning tasks.

## Models
We offer implementations for training the following models on the body shaming dataset:
- AlBERTo
- RoBERTa-xlm
- UmBERTo
